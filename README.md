# Exploring building a basic markdown parcer
Built a working markdown parser out of couriosity for how compilers and parcers work and to get more familar with markdown syntax/standards.
Used Regexp, recursion, modularity to build and export a function that could be used in anything Javascript based.

Used it to make a [live-editor](https://github.com/EmilEinarsen/react-markdown_live-editor) in React a while back
